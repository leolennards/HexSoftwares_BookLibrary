# 📚 Web Book Library App

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Book Library App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to manage a simple personal library by adding, searching, borrowing, and returning books.  
The app also uses **localStorage** to save data so that books remain even after refreshing the page.

This project was created as part of my **Hex Softwares Internship – Web Development Task 3**.
